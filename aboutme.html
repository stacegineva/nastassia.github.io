    <p class="maintext"> <br>My name is Nastassia Zhylnikava and I was born in Minsk, Belarus. <br> In September 2019 I moved to NYC all by myself. <br> <br> Being in creative sphere was always my thing. <br> At the age of 14-15 I was voice acting in amateur animated films. Worked as an line producer assistant and also as a content creator when I was 18. In 2018 my photos have been selected to a Digital Photo Exhibition in Minsk. I wrote a book of stories, which is only in Russian for now. <br> <br> I love to travel and make small videos. I'm finding inspiration in bookstores, people, especially people, and in movies. <br> My biggest dream is to take part in full-length animated movie creation either as an animator or as a producer.
